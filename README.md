## üåê Overview
TritonHub is a *differentiable*, efficient, and modular open-source library of PyTorch neural network modules and operations implemented in [Triton](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton). It provides GPU-accelerated primitives that leverage Triton's low-level control and parallelism, enabling seamless integration of deep learning building blocks into workflows. The framework supports both forward and backward passes while maintaining full compatibility with PyTorch, and can be easily extended and adapted to support the needs of the deep learning research and development community.

## üì¶ Installation

Clone the repository and install using `setup.py`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayoussf/TritonHub.git
cd TritonHub
python setup.py install
```

For development:
```bash
python setup.py develop
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
TritonHub requires the following dependencies:
- Linux operating system (WSL for Windows users)
- CUDA
- GPU hardware
- Triton (installed via pip or from [source](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton))

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
import torch
from TritonHub.Normalization import LayerNorm
from TritonHub.Activation import GeLU

batch, length, dim = 2, 100, 128
device = "cuda"
dtype = torch.float32 # or torch.float16

x = torch.randn(batch, length, dim, device=device, dtype=dtype).to("cuda")

layernorm = LayerNorm(128, eps=1e-6, elementwise_affine=True, bias=True, device=device, dtype=dtype)
gelu = GeLU(approximate='None') # or tanh approximation.

x = layernorm(x)
x = gelu(x)
```
